          <p>What is that? Also known as flaming, the use of unnecessary swearing and/or making fun of a disability sexual preference race or religion results in a ban or warning that will stay on your account forever, please just play nice. Farming</p>
          <p>Being a farm is the act of placing purely for the benefit of another player without taking part of the gameplay, or joining only to transfer resources to another player. Examples are joining only to provide scans or jams, make outposts for another player to take, make units for another player to kill to gain experience or join so that another player can conquer you for resources. Farming is viewed by administrators as an extremely high threat to a fair-play atmosphere, and farming will often result in a ban without warning! Sub Farming</p>
          <p>In the first official acknowledgement of sub alliances ever, Battle Dawn Administration has deemed it illegal to conquer sub alliances for any reason, including but not limited to taking crystals or preventing an enemy alliance from getting the conquer or crystals. This applies in all directions, so it does not matter if you are the sub or the main. If you find yourself in trouble for this, it will be important to prove to the administrator that the alliance in question is not a master or sub alliance in relation to you or your alliance. If you have or are a sub alliance, and relations start going bad between your brother (or sister) alliance, make it public, and communicate it as much as possible in-game so that you can report the messages to the admin as proof later if need be. It is advisable to inform your admin of any change in relationships with sub/main alliances as they happen. Admins will try to avoid a ban if you work with them, and good communication with the admin may just help you help them! Account Sharing</p>
          <p>Account Sharing: General Knowledge Account sharing is a violation of the Battle Dawn Terms Of Service. This is a serious matter, and if you are caught in violation of this rule, it can result in an in-game ban according to the severity of the account sharing. To put it simply, don't account share! What is Account Sharing? Account sharing is when one player logs onto another player's account to move squads, resources, or maintain account. When more than one player has logged in to the same account, this rule has been broken. How does one prevent this? Simple. Don't hand out your Battle Dawn password to anyone. Firstly, it's against the rules and you can be banned for it. Secondly, giving anyone your password will allow them access to all of your servers and the forums as "you". Any actions that happen on your account are your responsibility so don't allow anyone to use your account or you will be liable for it. Spam Bombing</p>
          <p>Creating, or having a friend create a colony completely out of nowhere to spam a bunch of outposts and colonies. Depending on the situation, the admin could very well decide to ban for this. Our only aim is to keep a fair and balanced play environment. Bug/Glitch Abuse</p>
          <p>What is a bug? A bug is a flaw in the programming, when triggered it can make something happen that isn't supposed to be happening. What is bug/glitch abuse? Bug abusing is as simple as its name. When players use a bug/glitch in the game to gain an advantage over another player, they could be banned for this especially if it is a widely known bug/glitch. How does one prevent this? As soon as you become aware of a bug/glitch, report it immediately to the in game Administrator. They will thank you for reporting it and possibly get rewarded. After reporting it, however, it does not give you free reign to use it. If you accidentally came across a bug report it immediately, if you report it and do your due diligence then you will not be punished about it. Multiple Accounts</p>
          <p>What is Multi-ing? Multi accounts are one player having two or more colonies on one server. In Battle Dawn, it is against the rules for a player to do this. Once the administrators find out, sanctions will be placed: all of the other accounts will be deleted, and the "main" account will usually be banned, either temporarily or permanently. Rules enforcement and Detection</p>
          <p>Who enforces the rules? In-game, the rules are enforced by the world administrator of each world. On the forums, rules are enforced by the forum moderators as well as forum and game administrators. What happens if I break the rules? That depends first the severity of your offense as well as your previous offense history. Your account has detailed notes on any interaction you have had with admins in the past. If you have done bad before, your chances of a ban for offenses goes up substantially! Typically an administrator will warn a player before resorting to banning their account. Again, previous warnings or bans will increase likelihood of a ban on a new offense! However, at least in-game, if you cheated and your cheating damaged the experience of fair-players, you also have a high likelihood of getting a ban to your account without warning! How do the administrators find cheaters? Administrators use a combination of player reports of suspicious behavior as well as various secret admin tools and investigation techniques to find cheating players. I have been banned!! What now?! Log into the Battle Dawn game client and access the world on which your ban originated, and contact your world admin. Honesty is always your best policy, so appeal to the admin whom issued the ban with all honesty and respect, and you will likely make things much easier on yourself. You can also reach the admin whom issued your ban by logging into the Battle Dawn forum and checking your messages inbox. You will find a "Board Warning Issued" message there. Reply directly to this message to launch your appeal directly to the admin whom issued your ban. Again, honesty and respect go a long way!</p>
