==An Introduction to Spies==

A spy is a special squad, which is moved exactly as any other squad - however it does not take part directly in battles - however it has the potential to do much more damage than a standard squad.

Spies have a multitude of uses, which are explained in detail in the [[Spies &amp; Covert Ops|Spies Article]], however in brief they are as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border='1'&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor='PaleGoldenRod'&gt;
&lt;td align='center' width='250'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Basic Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align='center' width='250'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
*Spread Virus &lt;br&gt;
*Destroy Vehicle Fuel Supplies &lt;br&gt;
*Destroy Heavy Vehicle Fuel Supplies &lt;br&gt;
*Boo! &lt;br&gt;
*Ignite Thrusters &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign='top'&gt;
*Drain Mana &lt;br&gt;
*Burn Lumber &lt;br&gt;
*Poison Water Supply &lt;br&gt;
*Lockdown &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

These 9 abilities make a spy a highly versatile instrument of attack, and can turn a certain loss into a certain victory - for both defenders and attackers.

It is important to consider both how to attack with the spy, and to defend against the spy, and that is what this article aims to teach.

==Attacking With the Spy==

Due to the versatility of the spy there are lots of strategic uses for the spy, and these are considered below:

===Lockdown Strategies===

The [[Spies &amp; Covert Ops#Lockdown|Lockdown]] function of the spy is one of the most powerful tools of the spy, however in itself it deals no damage. The Lockdown keeps all squads on the target there for between 3 and 6 ticks, which has many strategic uses.

&lt;table border='0'&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width='50' /&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
====Lockdown followed by a Nuke/Dragon====

The Nuke is a powerful tool, and can deal crippling damage to an army - however its main weakness is the dodge. Armies will rarely stay on an outpost if it is being nuked, however will often wait until the last minute to run. A Lockdown when the nuke is at ETA 3 from the target will force the defenders to ion the nuke, or suffer the losses. Ioning is not cheap, and in itself this can be a good result - however when combined with &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; nukes the odds of nukes being ioned get progressively smaller, and the effect of them not being nuked is progressively larger. A lockdown with 3-5 nukes will cripple an army, which will often choose retreat rather than continue on with a now suicidal attack.
&lt;br&gt;
====Lockdown followed by Further Spy Attacks====

The main weakness of the nuke is that even after being locked down there is an escape route for them, the ion cannon, which makes the lockdown virtually useless. This can be overcome by further spy attacks, assuming that the infiltration on the spy is sufficiently high, but does not deal the same level of damage as a nuke, especially a succession of nukes. By using the Spread Virus, Binding Thorns or Earthquake spy attacks soon after a lockdown you can reduce the units HP to 1, making the units vulnerable in subsequent attacks. This must be done as soon as the lockdown is complete, because it is likely spy protection will be layed down as soon as a spy is discovered within the outpost.
&lt;br&gt;
====Lockdown followed by Overwhelming Attack====

When faced with an army that will defeat your own most players will prefer a retreat - however a lockdown can prevent this, holding them there for the duration of the attack. As one can attack from just 3 ticks away it is possible to move units as close as possible and lockdown an opponent for the entire duration of the attack, forcing them to accept the battle, and, with a sufficiently large attacking army, lose that battle. This should be done with almost any use of the lockdown, using the nuke or spy attack strategies given above as a means to make the battle swing even further in your favour.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Spread Virus/Destroy Vehicle Fuel Supplies/Destroy Heavy Vehicle Fuel Supplies===

These three basic spy attacks can be used, especially early on, to turn a battle in your favour. Usually a defender will not retreat if there is a reasonable chance of them winning the battle, and one can exploit this by using these spy attacks at the last minute of an atack. Each reduces a single type of unit down to 1 hit point, and have comparitively low infiltration requirements. This makes them useful for spur-of-the-moment useage, reducing a colony's defences down in the early stages of the round and thus making the conquer simple.

As stated above they are also commonly used directly following a lockdown, but this requires a greater degree of infiltration, and thus more forward planning, as well as a greater degree of structures built - basic operations only require a lvl 2 building, but advanced operations require the lvl 4 building of the same type - making it harder to achieve early on.

===Drain Mana/Burn Lumber/Poison Water Supply===

These three do not have a direct attacking use, however are good at annoying a player. These are primarily used by conquered players against their conquerers, choosing a different form of attack to the use of units as often they are outmatched in army size. By far the most devestating is the [[Spies &amp; Covert Ops#Poison Water Supply|Poison Water Supply]] which reduces the worker count by 10% potentially crippling the income of the colony.

The [[Spies &amp; Covert Ops#Drain Energy|Drain Mana]] and [[Spies &amp; Covert Ops#Burn Oil|Burn Lumber]] operations do have a use outside of those conquered however. War is expensive, and a good way to make war even harder is to reduce the fuel they have to move or gate with. This is most useful if you get tipped off by someone that an alliance is planning a war against you - as successful spy attacks are annonymous you can periodically drain their Mana and Lumber, making their advance even harder - especially if you can use it whilst they are attempting their advancement.

These are less common strategies, but still worth consideration!


===Spy Traps===

Spies placed on strategically important &lt;b&gt;allied&lt;/b&gt; outpost can be used to trap enemy attacks, saving units through the use of the spy. In order to do this it is necessary to be able to predict which outposts they are going for, and cover them all with spies - and be online at the right time to trigger the trap.

This can be accomplished in two ways - finding a bottleneck between an advancing army and yourself, covering your gates, which are usually priority targets, with a spy on each of these, or alternatively when pushed back against your colonies as a last resort by baiting an attack on an outpost using a sizeable, but destroyable army on a strategically useful outpost.

With either approach the means to ennacting the spy trap is the same:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the &lt;b&gt;attack's ETA 1&lt;/b&gt; you plan how much is needed to destroy the attackers, when a spy has been activated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the last 30 seconds of the tick (in which the attackers are ETA 1 away) the units planned to defend are moved to the outpost, with an &lt;b&gt;ETA of 2&lt;/b&gt; (this eta is crucial)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simultaneously any units on the outpost move to a nearby outpost, again eta 2, and again in the last 30 seconds of the tick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon after the tick has passed, before any spy protection can be placed on the outpost, a lockdown and the necessary spy attack (Spread Virus, Binding Thorns or Earthquake) are activated, holding the units on that outpost, and weakening them sufficiently for the smaller army to defeat them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the units previously defending the colony are to be involved in the battle, they can now be recalled back to the outpost, switching them into an ETA 1 attack, allong with the units previously sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battle then takes place a tick later, with the larger army destroyed by the much smaller army, at a much lower cost than it would be without the spy's involvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Defending Against a Spy==

Spy attacks are lethal, and can be devestating - as a result it is vital that one knows how to defend against them. There are two main ways of doing this - spy protection and spy deployment.


===Using Spy protection===

[[Spies &amp; Covert Ops#Spy Protection|Spy Protection]] is the primary means of defending against spies, and should be maintained at all times. The most common place you will be spy attacked is your colony, often from players that you have conquered - as a result the location that requires most spy protection is your colony. It is best to set up your protection as soon as you build your spy, because it is the cheapest time to get the protection up. Getting it to 300 ticks of protection is usually more than enough to defend yourself, whilst allowing you to replace the spy protection every 50 ticks, keeping it at a high level of protection, at the lowest possible cost.

This costs a maximum of 20% of your energy production, but can be reduced by planning your spy attacks arround returning it to base every 50 ticks to reduce this cost to 8% of your income. It is even cheaper to use the [[Spies &amp; Covert Ops#Ignite Thrusters|Ignite Thrusters]] operation in conjuction with the reduced rate of spy protection than it is to keep it in place and use the more expensive rates.

Naturally of course it is not always possible to keep your spy returning to your colony every 50 ticks, it may be building infiltration on a difficult colony, or laying in a trap for an attacker, and in these instance it is in the long run cheaper to keep the spy in place and use a more expensive means of spy protection.

Spy protection however should not be limited to your colony - when attacking another alliance the outpost that your army is on should be outfitted with at least 100 ticks of protection before any units land, because it is an obvious target for any spy attacks. Relics are another good location to have spy protection, because other alliances are liable to place their own spies on it to aid in capturing the relic.

===Using Spy Deployment===

If your spy has a greater infiltration in an allied outpost than an opposing spy it will capture the spy as soon as a spy attack is initiated, forgoing the need for spy protection to be placed. This is a good way to defend something such as a relic in the long run, or to use as spy protection in preperation for a trap. However it has the major disadvantage that it renders your spy, which you only have one of, useless to attack with.

A relic is a major target for a spy attack, or indeed an attack of any kind, and as a result it is potentially worth having an allied spy permenantly defending it, both as a trap for any successful attack, or as a means to prevent spies being used to ease an attacker taking it.

*[[Spies &amp; Covert Ops]]




&lt;!-- This is an archied previous version of the spy traps, which can be ignored

When advancing an army there are key points that should be taken - gates, nukes etc. and this can be used to the defenders advantage - by predicting where their opponents army is going to land they can place spies at these key locations well in advance, building a large infiltration on them whilst they are still allied outposts, ready to be used as soon as the outpost is lost. This strategy is most powerful when combined with the lockdown strategies considered above, however is still very devastating when a lockdown is unavailable.

Defending units can even be placed on the outpost prior to their attack, using the spy infiltration as an efficient defence against spy attacks, and simultaneously preparing the trap for the enemy. Seeing a large army they may attempt to crush it, using an even larger army to attack. At the last minute the defending units can run to a nearby outpost, losing the outpost but saving the units. As soon as the tick passes a lockdown and spy attack can be innitiated on the outpost, and the units recalled to force the battle a tick later, with the odds significantly turned in the defenders favour.

This is the most dangerous strategy for a spy, but also one of the hardest to set up - worth considering both as the attacker and the defender!!! --&gt;</textarea>
